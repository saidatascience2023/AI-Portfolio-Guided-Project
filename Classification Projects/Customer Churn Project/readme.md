## Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn refers to customers who stop doing business with a company. By identifying such customers in advance, businesses can take proactive steps to retain them.

### Data Dictionary
The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month ‚Äì the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for ‚Äì phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

Customer account information ‚Äì how long they‚Äôve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

Demographic info about customers ‚Äì gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## üîç Problem Statement or Goal 

Telecom and subscription-based companies often face the challenge of losing customers. This project builds a predictive model that classifies customers as **churned** or **not churned** based on their behavior and demographic data.
