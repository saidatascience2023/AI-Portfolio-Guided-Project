## Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn refers to customers who stop doing business with a company. By identifying such customers in advance, businesses can take proactive steps to retain them.

### Data Dictionary
The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month ‚Äì the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for ‚Äì phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

Customer account information ‚Äì how long they‚Äôve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

Demographic info about customers ‚Äì gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## üîç Problem Statement or Goal 

Telecom and subscription-based companies often face the challenge of losing customers. This project builds a predictive model that classifies customers as **churned** or **not churned** based on their behavior and demographic data.

## üì¶ Strategy to Solve the Problem

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
  Handle missing values, correct data types, encode categorical variables, and scale features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Understand distributions, spot trends, visualize churn behavior, and identify outliers.

- **Model Training**  
  Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and perform hyperparameter tuning.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Assess performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

- **Feature Importance**  
  Identify which features contribute most to customer churn using model insights.

- **Deployment**  
  Export trained model and build a simple script or web app for real-time prediction.
